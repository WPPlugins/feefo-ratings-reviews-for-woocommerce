As an official Google Content Partner, **all Feefo reviews are 100% verified and sent directly to Google**. These reviews can appear as **Google Stars** within organic listings and as **Seller Ratings** within AdWords campaigns.

Google stars, whether displayed organically or as part of paid campaigns can increase inbound traffic to your site, for example Feefo reviews can increase your AdWords Click through Rates **(CTR) by an average of 17%**. Feefo customer reviews can facilitate SEO and the volume of inbound organic traffic - by improving bounce rates and helping to keep the content of a page fresh (both key ranking factors).

Additionally, Feefo customer reviews are used as part of Content Marketing, Email Marketing, Social Media, Advertising and PR campaigns - all of which increases visibility and ultimately the volume of traffic to your website.
